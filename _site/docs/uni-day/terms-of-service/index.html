xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> <strong>Terms of Use</strong></h1><p>Uni.day is a personalized subscription service that makes a schedule and builds a timetable via your mobile device.</p><p>These Terms of Use govern your use of the Uni.day Service. References to “Uni.day” or “our service” in these Terms of Use refer to the overall service, including the website, user interface, and all content and software associated with the service, provided by us under the service name “Uni.day”.</p><h2 id="1-scope-of-service-and-subscription"> <a href="#1-scope-of-service-and-subscription" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="1-scope-of-service-and-subscription"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 1. Scope of Service and Subscription</h2><p>1.1. The Uni.day service includes services such as making a schedule, building a time table, adding a task and other services provided by membership. Free services may be converted to paid services at our discretion. Uni.day services require internet access and a supported device, and one or more payment methods depending on the type of membership.</p><p>1.2 A Uni.day membership consists of eliminating ads and other services are available depending on the type of membership. Details can be found on the ‘Manage Subscription’ screen.</p><p>1.3 Your Uni.day membership lasts until canceled. ‘Payment Methods’ means the currently validly accepted payment methods, which may be updated as necessary, and may include payments through third party accounts. Signing up for a Membership means that you agree to make periodic payments for the cost of the Membership, and as such, if you do not cancel your Membership by the payment date, your Payment Method will be charged for the next billing cycle’s Membership fee (see ‘Termination’ below).</p><h2 id="2-membership-payment-and-termination"> <a href="#2-membership-payment-and-termination" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="2-membership-payment-and-termination"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 2. Membership Payment and Termination</h2><p>2.1. Membership fees for the Uni.day Services, including billing cycles, and any other charges incurred in connection with the use of the Services (e.g., taxes, transaction fees, etc.) will be charged to the payment method on file on the payment date shown on the ‘Manage Subscription’ page. Uni.day is not responsible for any charges to third parties. Uni.day may take steps to collect any fees owed by a Member for the Service, and the Member is responsible for any related collection costs and expenses. The billing cycle is determined by the membership type selected by the Member when signing up for Uni.day. The billing date may change in some circumstances, such as if the registered payment method does not process properly, if a paid membership is initiated on a date that does not exist in a particular month, or if the Member changes the membership type. You can view your payment method and next billing date through the “Manage Subscriptions” page in the App.</p><p>2.2. Payment Methods. To use the Uni.day Services, you must provide one or more payment methods. You are responsible for any outstanding amounts. If a payment is not properly processed for any reason, such as expiration, insufficient funds, etc., and the Member does not cancel their account, the Member’s access to the Services may be restricted until a valid payment method is charged. For some payment methods, the issuer may charge the member a fee, such as a foreign transaction fee or other fees associated with processing the payment method. Local taxes may vary depending on the payment method used. Please check with your payment method service provider for more information.</p><p>2.3. Updating Payment Methods. Members can update their payment method by going to the ‘Manage Subscription’ screen. Uni.day may also update a Member’s payment method using information provided by the applicable payment service provider. By updating a Member’s payment method, the Member authorizes Uni.day to continue billing that payment method.</p><p>2.4.1. Termination (Member). Members may terminate their Uni.day membership at any time, and all terminations will be effective the next billing period. In this case, you may continue to use the Uni.day Services until the end of the billing cycle. Except for terminations that meet the requirements of mandatory law and these Terms 2.5, and any obligation to provide a refund based on Uni.day’s willful misconduct or negligence (the burden of proof for Uni.day’s willful misconduct or negligence is on the Member), no refunds or credits will be provided for periods of unused membership. To terminate your membership, please go to the ‘Manage Subscription’ screen and follow the instructions for termination.</p><p>2.4.2. Termination. Uni.day may terminate the Services and the Agreement at any time for any of the following reasons. However, in addition to the reasons below, we may provide notice of termination within the Service Content at least 30 days prior to termination if necessary.</p><ul><li>If the Member violates any provision of these Terms or appears to be unwilling or unable to comply with these Terms.<li>If the Member violates the laws governing the Service in Korea or the laws governing the country in which the Member uses the Service, or engages in other acts that violate social norms, such as illegal acts against third parties.<li>If the Member fails to pay the fees for the Service.<li>The provision of the Services to the Member is or may become illegal.</ul><p>2.5. Refund Request. Members can cancel their Uni.day membership through their account within 7 days from the date of payment. However, if a member has used a paid payment service after payment, they cannot request a refund of the membership fee. In addition, we may take measures to restrict the use of the Service if we believe that the member is using the Service in an unfair manner, such as using the Service within a short period of time after payment and requesting a refund using the Service’s refund policy within 7 days. However, the refund entity may differ depending on the payment method, in which case the refund will be made through the place of purchase.</p><p>2.6. Changes to Fees and Memberships. Uni.day reserves the right to change its Service fees and membership configurations. Uni.day will obtain Member’s consent to any changes to Service fees and memberships, including when they will take effect, by providing Member with a notice in the Service Content 15 days prior to the change. If Member does not consent to the change, Member may terminate his or her Uni.day membership.</p><h2 id="3-uniday-service"> <a href="#3-uniday-service" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="3-uniday-service"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 3. Uni.day Service</h2><p>3.1. In the case of Uni.day paid membership, refunds may be denied after payment depending on the device name and payment method. In other words, if a minor requests a refund on the grounds that he/she used his/her parent’s payment method without parental consent, the legal representative of the minor must prove such circumstances.</p><h2 id="4-warranty-and-limitation-of-liability"> <a href="#4-warranty-and-limitation-of-liability" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="4-warranty-and-limitation-of-liability"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 4. Warranty and Limitation of Liability</h2><p>4.1. Uni.day endeavors to provide stable services. However, Uni.day may modify, update, or discontinue the Service, Software, or any part thereof at any time without liability to the Member. In the event of a complete discontinuation of the Service, a pro rata refund of any unused fees for such Service prepaid by the Member may be provided.</p><h2 id="5-miscellaneous"> <a href="#5-miscellaneous" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="5-miscellaneous"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 5. Miscellaneous</h2><p>5.1. Governing Law. These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Korea.</p><p>5.2. Customer Center.
