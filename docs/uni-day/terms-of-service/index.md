1\. Scope of Service and Subscription

1.1. The Pill Butler service includes services such as taking photos, registering medications, storing medication records, storing body temperature records, and storing records of taking antipyretic drugs, which are provided free of charge, and other services provided by membership. Free services may be converted to paid services at our discretion. Pill Butler services require internet access and a supported device, and one or more payment methods depending on the type of membership.

1.2 A Pill Butler membership consists of unlimited registration of medications, a choice of all icons, a choice of all alarm sounds, and unlimited registration of multiprofiles, and other services are available depending on the type of membership. Details can be found on the 'Manage Subscription' screen.

1.3 Your Pill Butler membership lasts until canceled. 'Payment Methods' means the currently validly accepted payment methods, which may be updated as necessary, and may include payments through third party accounts. Signing up for a Membership means that you agree to make periodic payments for the cost of the Membership, and as such, if you do not cancel your Membership by the payment date, your Payment Method will be charged for the next billing cycle's Membership fee (see 'Termination' below).

2\. Membership Payment and Termination

2.1. Membership fees for the Pill Butler Services, including billing cycles, and any other charges incurred in connection with the use of the Services (e.g., taxes, transaction fees, etc.) will be charged to the payment method on file on the payment date shown on the 'Manage Subscription' page. Pill Butler is not responsible for any charges to third parties. Pill Butler may take steps to collect any fees owed by a Member for the Service, and the Member is responsible for any related collection costs and expenses. The billing cycle is determined by the membership type selected by the Member when signing up for Pill Butler. The billing date may change in some circumstances, such as if the registered payment method does not process properly, if a paid membership is initiated on a date that does not exist in a particular month, or if the Member changes the membership type. You can view your payment method and next billing date through the "Manage Subscriptions" page in the App.

2.2. Payment Methods. To use the Pill Butler Services, you must provide one or more payment methods. You are responsible for any outstanding amounts. If a payment is not properly processed for any reason, such as expiration, insufficient funds, etc., and the Member does not cancel their account, the Member's access to the Services may be restricted until a valid payment method is charged. For some payment methods, the issuer may charge the member a fee, such as a foreign transaction fee or other fees associated with processing the payment method. Local taxes may vary depending on the payment method used. Please check with your payment method service provider for more information.

2.3. Updating Payment Methods. Members can update their payment method by going to the 'Manage Subscription' screen. Pill Butler may also update a Member's payment method using information provided by the applicable payment service provider. By updating a Member's payment method, the Member authorizes Pill Butler to continue billing that payment method.

2.4.1. Termination (Member). Members may terminate their Pill Butler membership at any time, and all terminations will be effective the next billing period. In this case, you may continue to use the Pill Butler Services until the end of the billing cycle. Except for terminations that meet the requirements of mandatory law and these Terms 2.5, and any obligation to provide a refund based on Pill Butler's willful misconduct or negligence (the burden of proof for Pill Butler's willful misconduct or negligence is on the Member), no refunds or credits will be provided for periods of unused membership. To terminate your membership, please go to the 'Manage Subscription' screen and follow the instructions for termination.

- If the Member fails to pay the fees for the Service.
- The provision of the Services to the Member is or may become illegal.

2.5. Refund Request. Members can cancel their Pill Butler membership through their account within 7 days from the date of payment. However, if a member has used a paid payment service after payment, they cannot request a refund of the membership fee. In addition, we may take measures to restrict the use of the Service if we believe that the member is using the Service in an unfair manner, such as using the Service within a short period of time after payment and requesting a refund using the Service's refund policy within 7 days. However, the refund entity may differ depending on the payment method, in which case the refund will be made through the place of purchase.

2.6. Changes to Fees and Memberships. Pill Butler reserves the right to change its Service fees and membership configurations. Pill Butler will obtain Member's consent to any changes to Service fees and memberships, including when they will take effect, by providing Member with a notice in the Service Content 15 days prior to the change. If Member does not consent to the change, Member may terminate his or her Pill Butler membership.

3\. Pill Butler Service
